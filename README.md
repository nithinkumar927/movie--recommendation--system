Movie Recommendation System
A practical movie recommendation project showcasing common approaches such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and popularity baselines to generate relevant suggestions for users. The design emphasizes an approachable setup, clear reproducible steps, and a modular structure so the system can be extended or deployed as a simple web app.​​

Features
Content-based recommendations leveraging metadata features like genres, keywords, or text embeddings to compute similarity between movies.​

Collaborative filtering pathway that uses user–item interactions to infer tastes and surface similar items or user-neighborhood suggestions.​

Popularity baseline for quick, data-light recommendations and sanity checks during development and evaluation.​

Simple local run options via Python CLI or a lightweight web UI pattern typical for rapid demos and portfolio projects.​​

Extensible evaluation with standard metrics such as precision@k, recall@k, and coverage to compare multiple recommenders.​

Project overview
This repository provides a minimal, end-to-end workflow: data preparation, feature building, similarity or model computation, and a small interface to request movie recommendations. The architecture is intentionally modular so you can swap content features, try neighborhood-based or model-based collaborative filtering, and iterate on ranking strategies.​

Tech stack
Python for data processing, similarity computation, and model logic, aligning with common open-source recommender examples.​

Optional Streamlit-style app pattern for rapid local demos and deployment tutorials, while remaining framework-agnostic in code organization.​​

Getting started
Prerequisites: Python 3.8+ and pip, which are standard for most tutorial and reference implementations of recommendation systems.​

Create a virtual environment for clean, reproducible installs across platforms and machines during development.​

bash
# 1) Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install dependencies

Quick run
CLI mode: run the main script to generate recommendations in the console or to precompute similarity/model artifacts.​

bash
python app.py
Running a simple entry point makes it straightforward to test core recommendation logic without a front-end.​

Web app mode (if included): launch a minimal UI to search a title and view recommended results.​​

bash
streamlit run app.py
Lightweight web apps are popular for showcasing ML demos and enable quick sharing of recommendation results to users or reviewers.​​
